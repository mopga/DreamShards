Title: "Shards of Dreams"

Genre: 2D RPG with turn-based combat, narrative-driven

Core Concept:
A surreal, dreamlike RPG where the player explores symbolic dream-palaces inhabited by shadows and distorted avatars of inner fears. The game combines dungeon-crawling in abstract palaces with deep branching dialogues and story scenes. Visual aesthetics should feel mystical, fragmented, and slightly uncanny, as if dreams are breaking into pieces.

Gameplay Features:
1. Exploration:
   - 2D movement through palace maps, designed as surreal dungeons full of symbolic elements (floating stairs, broken statues, shifting rooms).
   - Each palace represents a different archetypal theme (e.g. Pride, Fear, Desire).

2. Combat:
   - Turn-based system, similar to JRPGs like Persona.
   - Party-based: the protagonist plus dream-companions.
   - Enemies are "Shadows" — abstract dark creatures.
   - Bosses are "Avatars" — giant manifestations of distorted archetypes.
   - Mechanics: basic attacks, skills (magic/psychic abilities), guarding, exploiting weaknesses, special limit-break style moves.

3. Narrative:
   - Story unfolds between exploration and battles.
   - Dialogues with branching choices that affect relationships, story outcomes, and palace progression.
   - Key NPC: Lister — a mysterious guide on the beach of dreams, who helps explain the meaning of dream fragments.
   - Collecting "Dream Shards" (special items) unlocks new dialogue options and endings.

4. Progression:
   - Player collects shards to unlock new palaces and abilities.
   - Choices in dialogue influence which companions join and how the story unfolds.
   - Multiple possible endings depending on collected shards and player choices.

Visual & Audio Style:
- 2D pixel-art or illustrated style.
- Dreamlike palettes: twilight beaches, glowing symbols on stones, surreal landscapes.
- UI: clean and mystical, with symbols representing actions (sword, shield, star).
- Music: ambient, haunting, and layered with subtle motifs that change between palaces.

Technical Requirements:
- 2D engine (HTML5 compatible).
- Must support dialogue system with branching choices.
- Must support turn-based combat with a party system and enemy weaknesses.
- Save/load functionality.
- Modular design so new palaces, enemies, and dialogues can be added easily.

Stretch Goals (Optional for MVP):
- Companion relationship system (friendship/loyalty levels).
- Animated cutscenes between palaces.
- Puzzle elements inside palaces.

Overall Mood:
The game should feel like stepping into a broken dream world where logic bends, choices matter, and the player battles both external shadows and their inner self.
